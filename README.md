## Learn. Help People. Enjoy Life.
(my main three things)
### About me:
- AF Ord veteran
- curious
- goofy
- dark mode
- pirate mode

### Currently working on:
[Schoolwork Tracker](https://github.com/elguapogordo/schoolwork_tracker), an app that will track students' progress through multiple subjects.
- designed to have a visual `how far ahead/behind are you` for my kids while doing school at home, but could have other applications
- will have some 'just because' database queries on the show pages because I need more ActiveRecord and SQL practice
- MySQL database (installed with much frustration because I repeated the same mistake I made with PostgreSQL)
- will eventually be deployed, may use CI/CD at some point
- using feature branches with commits and comments

if anyone looks at the code, comments, or git practices and has any comments or suggestions, feel free to contact me!
